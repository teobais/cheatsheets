Updating package in npm

npm version patch
git add *;
git commit -m "Commit message"
git push
git push --tags
npm publish

-or just after a push-
npm version patch
git push --tags  (if push command isn't set to push by default to master, then you have to explicitly git push origin master --tags)
npm publish

Bower automatically detects new versions of your package based on Git tags. Super smart and makes publishing updated packages to Bower seamless.
